Transports
===========

We will use http transport as example.

``` python
from arsenalqa.fields import Field
from arsenalqa.models import Model
from arsenalqa.transports import TransportManager
from arsenalqa.transports.http import Http


class User(Model):

    http: Http = TransportManager(Http, url='http://example.com/users/{id}/')

    username = Field()
    name = Field()
    id = Field()


user = User()
user.id = 1
print(user.http.get())
>>> M:{'id': 1, 'name': 'Jhon', 'username': 'JhonDoe'}
```
We has added new http transport with TransportManager and Http class. Now we can use all of http methods(POST, GET, PUT, etc.)
with our model. By default all responses are wrapped in new instance of current model(User in our case)

``` python
response = user.http.get()
print(type(response))
>>> '<class __main__.User>'
# response is not the same instance as we sent(this is true for their data too)
print(user is response)
>>> False
# But they are equals
print(user == response)
```
This behavior was made for QA engineers. We always need to comparison of expected and actual results. That's why we don't
update our current model by response.

**How does it works?**

When we get `user.http` attribute first time, the TransportManager creates new instance of Http class, and sets others
parameters like:

``` python
Http(url='http://example.com/users/{id}/', model=user)
# Parameter `model` has been added by TransportManager backend.
```
TransportManager links the instance of Http to our `user` instance back.
When we call `user.http` again, we will use the same instance of Http as before.

**How does Http understands how to get a user with id=1?**

``` python
class User(Model):

    http: Http = TransportManager(Http, url='http://example.com/users/{id}/')
    ...
```
It is url pattern. It works like `safe format`. `Http.prepare_url` method gets url, and trying to fill out all `{name}`
parameters from model fields. After this procedure, it strips all `//` symbol duplicates, except scheme(http://).

In this case, if my REST service returns list of users on `http://example.com/users/` resource, then I can get it, if
`user.id` attribute is blank:

``` python
user = User()
print(user.http.get())

>>> I:[{'id': 7, 'name': 'Emily Scott', 'username': 'harrisonnicholas'}, {'id': 8, 'name': 'Shannon Douglas', 'username': 'jason41'},...
```
We can get list of users from `User` class:

``` python
print(User.http.get())

>>> I:[{'id': 7, 'name': 'Emily Scott', 'username': 'harrisonnicholas'}, {'id': 8, 'name': 'Shannon Douglas', 'username': 'jason41'},...
```
When we calling http from class, it creates new instance of Http on every call.

``` python
print(User.http.get())  # first Http instance
print(User.http.get())  # second Http instance
```
Http methods like POST, PUT and PATCH takes request body from linked `model.data` attribute.

``` python
user = User()
user.name = 'Jhon'
user.username = 'JhonDoe'

print(user.http.post())  # first Http instance
>>> M:{'id': 1, 'name': 'Jhon', 'username': 'JhonDoe'}
# This user was created by POST method. Attribute `id` was set by the server.
```
Before sending POST request `Http.post` takes `model.data` from model. `model.data` is python prepared data(dict) for sending to the web.
It means that, all dates saved as strings, all submodels saved as dicts or lists of dicts and etc.
