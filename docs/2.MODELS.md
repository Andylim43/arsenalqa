Models
=======

Model is a class, that helps you to operate with your data.

For example. We have json entity User:

``` json
{"name": "Jhon", "username": "JhonDoe", "id": 1}
```
We can represent this entity like python model:


``` python
from arsenalqa.fields import Field
from arsenalqa.models import Model


class User(Model):

    username = Field()
    name = Field()
    id = Field()
```

Lets create new instance of User, and fill it out.

``` python
user = User()
user.name = "Jhon"
user.username = "JhonDoe"
user.id = 1
print(user)
>>> M:{'name': 'Jhon', 'username': 'JhonDoe', 'id': 1}
```
We see model, that looks like python dict, but this is not a dict. This is your wrapper for manipulations around dict.
When we fill model fields - fields represents your data and saves it in attribute "data":

``` python
print(user.data)
>>> {'name': 'Jhon', 'username': 'jhonDoe', 'id': 1}
```
Attribute data is a temporary storage of your "raw" python dict. This dict is a prepared data for sending by transports.

Model can be linked to existing dict:

``` python
user_dict = {'name': 'Jhon', 'username': 'jhonDoe', 'id': 1}
user = User.wrap(user_dict)

user_copy_1 = User.wrap(user_dict)
user_copy_2 = User()
user_copy_2.data = user_dict

print(user == user_copy == user_copy_2)
>>> True
print(user is user_copy is user_copy_2)
>>> False
```
All 3 model instances wraps one dict. If we change this dict, it will be changed in all linked models.

``` python
user_dict = {'name': 'Jhon', 'username': 'jhonDoe', 'id': 1}
user_dict['name'] = 'Andrew'
print(user.name)
>>> Andrew
print(user_copy_1.name)
>>> Andrew
print(user_copy_2.name)
>>> Andrew
```
Models only creates new dicts, if they wasn't linked on existing dicts in creation time.
