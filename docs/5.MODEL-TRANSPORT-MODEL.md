Model-Transport-Model relations
================================

Relations between entities are very important part. If you have visual relations in your code, you can see how this code
works without documentations.

We can make relations between models by transports. It means that you can create model, send model data by http, receive
response wrapped in other model instance, and make a new request from this model.

Our user entity has has relation with his games.

``` python
from arsenalqa.fields import Field
from arsenalqa.models import Model
from arsenalqa.transports import TransportManager
from arsenalqa.transports.http import Http


class Game(Model):

    http: Http = TransportManager(Http, url='http://example.com/games/{id}/')

    id = Field()
    name = Field()
    user_id = Field()  # relation field with our User model
    wins = Field()
    defeats = Field()

print(Game.http.get())
>>> I:[{'id': 3, 'name': 'WOWS', 'user_id': 12, 'wins': 0, 'defeats': 1}, {'id': 14, 'name': 'BLITZ', 'user_id': 7, 'wins': 12, 'defeats': 4},...
```
This is a list of games which play our users. This end user logic is looks like:

- User creates his own account first.
- User starts playing in one of our games.
- Server backend creates new relation between user profile and game.

User can find his games in `http://example.com/users/{id}/games/` resource.
All users games resource is `http://example.com/games/{id}/`

Lets adapt our user model and Http.

``` python
from arsenalqa.fields import Field
from arsenalqa.models import Model
from arsenalqa.transports import TransportManager
from arsenalqa.transports.http import Http


class Game(Model):

    http: Http = TransportManager(Http, url='http://example.com/games/{id}/')

    id = Field()
    name = Field()
    user_id = Field()  # relation field with our User model
    wins = Field()
    defeats = Field()


class UserHttp(Http):

    def get_games(self, wrapper=Game.wrap, expected_status=200, **kwargs):
        return self.get(
            url=urljoin(self.url, 'games/'),
            wrapper=wrapper,
            expected_status=expected_status,
            **kwargs
        )


class User(Model):

    http: Http = TransportManager(UserHttp, url='http://example.com/users/{id}/')

    username = Field()
    name = Field()
    id = Field()
```
Our relation is ready in `UserHttp` class. It contains one new method `get_games`:

- `wrapper=Game.wrap` this parameter says which wrapper callable should be used.
- `expected_status=200` validates that response status is 200, if not raises exception.

``` python
user = User()
user.id = 1
print(user.http.get_games())
>>> I:[{'id': 1, 'name': 'WOW', 'user_id': 1, 'wins': 334969, 'defeats': 88385}, {'id': 2, 'name': 'BLITZ', 'user_id': 1, 'wins': 564080, 'defeats': 976097}]
```
Method has returns list of games wrapped in Game model. Lets get one game from this user games and make request in chain.

``` python
print(user.http.get_games()[0].http.get())
>>> M:{'id': 1, 'name': 'WOW', 'user_id': 1, 'wins': 334969, 'defeats': 88385}
```
We got user games list which elements wrapped in Game model(`user.http.get_games()`), than we got first game(`[0]`) model,
and made a request to `http://example.com/games/{id}/` resource(`.http.get()`) which returns new Game model instance.
